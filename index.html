        <h1>Sports Marketer turned Web Developer</h1>
        <p>Hi there, my name is Nate Grossmann. I'm 25 years old and based in Denver, Colorado. I started the first four years of my professional career creating exciting experiences for collegiate sports fans. In that time I learned a host of skills including graphic design, social media marketing and how to operate a t-shirt cannon. <br>
        I have always been drawn to marketing and the art of matching products with people. After COVID-19 hit, I decided to make the switch to web development so that I could create products myself. Since then I have helped small businesses bring their brands to life by building them full-stack web apps and fast, responsive websites. <br>
        When I'm not coding you can find me running, swimming, playing hockey or practicing Spanish.
